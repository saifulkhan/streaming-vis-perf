# About

Interface for implementing and benchmarking performance of different visualizations.

## Getting Started Locally

Prerequisites

Please make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (LTS version) and [Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) (`npm install --global yarn`).

```sh
node --version
## should output ≥ 14.17

yarn --version
## should output ≥ 1.22
```

Start development instance:

Install the dependencies.

```sh
yarn install
```

Run the app in development mode using production APIs (you don’t need to start the development instances of the API endpoints).

```sh
yarn dev
```

While the web server is running, you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.
To stop the server, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal.

Figure 8 Caption:
A sample visualization that counts the completed turns for 
particles moving in a circle, rendered with SVG (left) and SSVG (right) over one minute each. 
While the particles have made 18 turns with SSVG, only 5 turns were completed with SVG. 
The number of particles is gradually increased. SSVG's rendering contains more particles, 
demonstrating its higher compute performance.

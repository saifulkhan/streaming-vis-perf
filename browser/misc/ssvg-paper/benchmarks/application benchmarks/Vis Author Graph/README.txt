Figure 13 Caption:
IEEE VIS Information Visualization paper authors of the last 10 years, 
visualized by a combination of geolocation and co-authorship of papers.
Author nodes are sized by number of papers and colored by affiliation. 
Authors with at least 8 papers are shown with initials, such as Hanspeter Pfister(HP) 
or Sheelagh Carpendale (SC). Visualization researchers on the US east cost often 
collaborate with Europe, and researchers from Australia tend tocollaborate with the US and Europe. 
Several authors are placed far from their institution. For example, Tim Dwyer (TD) and Huamin Qu (HQ)
are placedfar from Australia and Hong Kong, respectively, due to co-authorships with collaborators 
in the US and Europe. Without SSVG, this visualization’slayout takes 16 seconds to compute, whereas with SSVG, 
the layout only takes 5 seconds and the visualization renders smoothly

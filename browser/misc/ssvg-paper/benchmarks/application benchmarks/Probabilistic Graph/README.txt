Figure 12 Caption:
A graph layout with 6000 elements rendered with SSVG that couldbe used as a starting point to
make Schulz’ work open and accessibleon the web. Implementation was done within one hour with SVG. 
SVGrendering is at 9 FPS and the layout takes 79 seconds to stabilize. WithSSVG, rendering is smooth 
at 23 FPS and arrives at a stable secondswithin 27 seconds. Available at ssvg.io/examples/probabilistic.
